# 🔐 Secure Password Manager — MERN Stack

A **production-grade Password Manager** built using the MERN stack with a strong focus on  
**security, encryption, usability, and real-world architecture**.

This application allows users to safely store, manage, and audit their credentials inside a protected vault — similar in concept to tools like Bitwarden or 1Password.

🔗 Backend API: https://passvault-backend-ikj0.onrender.com

✅ Health Check Endpoint: https://passvault-backend-ikj0.onrender.com/api/health

⚠️ Note: Signup/Login is enabled, but abuse is prevented using OTP throttling + rate limiting.

⚠️ Demo credentials available on request (for security reasons).

# 🎯 Why This Project Stands Out

Most password manager projects stop at saving encrypted data. This project goes much further and mirrors real security products:

- Zero‑knowledge‑inspired architecture
- Client‑side encryption before data reaches the server
- Secure session & refresh token handling
- Vault auto‑locking and trusted devices
- Audit logging & rate limiting
- Built with security reviews, scalability, and recruiters in mind.

## 📌 Resume-Ready Project Summary

PassVault is a **security-first password manager** built with the MERN stack, implementing a **zero-knowledge-inspired vault architecture** where all sensitive credentials are encrypted client-side before reaching the backend.

The system includes **OTP-based login verification**, **trusted device binding**, **refresh token rotation**, and **audit logging** to mirror real-world authentication workflows used in modern security products.

Designed as a production-grade project showcasing expertise in:

- Secure authentication & session management  
- Encryption-based vault systems  
- Scalable backend API engineering  
- Real-world security practices & monitoring 


# ✨ Core Features
## 🔐 Authentication & Account Security

- Secure signup & login flow
- Email‑based OTP verification
- Two‑Factor Authentication (2FA)

- Trusted device tracking
- Session restore & auto logout


## 🧠 Zero‑Knowledge Vault Architecture
- Client‑side encryption (server never sees plaintext secrets)
- Encrypted password storage
- Master password never stored
- Vault auto‑locks after inactivity
- Manual vault lock/unlock


## 🗄️ Password Vault

- Password add/edit/delete events logs
- IP address & device metadata
- Vault access monitoring
- Tamper-resistant backend audit architecture 

## 🛡️ Advanced Security Features
- Password strength meter (zxcvbn)
- Breach detection checks
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- Secure error handling (no info leakage)
- CSRF-safe authentication via cookies + tokens 

## 📦 Additional Capabilities
- Import / Export passwords
- Profile photo upload
